# Hexoplex

Alright guys, init this repo in your local machine and load the Hexoplex project not the entire repo onto your xcode, then we can all be in sync with each other's contributions. 

Also, if you ever want to merge, you should git add . then git commit -m "message" and then git pull. This will keep your code and add the changes made to the repo. If you know this already, ignore my ignorance!
